Python Assessment
-------------------

#### Q1. What is an abstract class?
- An abstract class is the name for any class from which you can instantiate an object.
- Abstract classes must be redefined any time an object is instantiated from them 
- Abstract classes must inherit from concrete classes.
- An abstract class exists only so that other "concrete" classes can inherit from the abstract class. - True

#### Q2. What happens when you use the build-in function "any()" on a list?
- The "any()" function will randomly return any item from the list.
- The "any()" function returns True if any item in the list evaluates to True. Otherwise, it returns Fals. - True
- The "any()" function takes as arguments the list to check inside, and the item to check for. If "any" of the items in the list match the item to check for, the function returns True.
- The "any()" function returns a Boolean value that answers the question "Are there any items in this list?"

#### Q3. What data structure does a binary tree degenerate to if it isn't balanced properly?
- linked list - True
- queue
- set 
- OrderedDict

#### Q4. What is a static method?
- Static methods are called static because they always return "None".
- Static methods can be bound to either a class or an instance of a class.
- They serve mostly as utility methods or helper methods, since they can't access or modify a class's state. - True
- Static methods can access and modify the state of a class or an instance of a class.

#### Q5. What are attributes?
- Attributes are long-form version of an "if/else" statement, used when testing for equality between objects.
- Attributes are a way to hold data or describe a state for a class or an instance of a class.  - True
- Attributes are strings that describe characteristics of a class.
- Function arguments are called "attributes" in the context of class methods and instance methods.

#### Q6. What is the term to describe this code?
```javascript
count, fruit, price = (2, 'apple', 3.5)
```
- tuple assignment
- tuple unpacking    - True
- tuple matching
- tuple duplication

#### Q7. What built-in list method would you use to remove items from a list?
- `".delete()" method`
- `pop(my_list)`
- `del(my_list)`
- `".pop()" method`    - True

#### Q8. What is one of the most common use of Python's sys library?
- to capture command-line arguments given at a file's runtime
- to connect varios systems, such as connecting a web front end, an API service, a database, and a mobile app
- to take a snapshot of all the packages and libraries in your virtual environment
- to scan the health of your Python ecosystem while inside a virtual environment  - True

#### Q9. What is the runtime of accessing a value in a dictionary by using its key?
- "O(n)", also called linear time
- "O(log n)", also called logarithmic time
- "O(n^2)", also called quadratic time
- "O(1)", also called constant time   - True

#### Q10. What is the runtime complexity of the list's built-in .append() method?
- "O(n)", also called linear time
- "O(log n)", also called logarithmic time
- "O(n^2)", also called quadratic time
- "O(1)", also called constant time   - True

#### Q11. What is the correct syntax for defining a class called Game?
- `class Game: 
       pass`
- `def Game(): 
       pass`
- `def Game: 
       pass`
- `class Game(): 
       pass`     - True

#### Q12. What is the correct way to write a doctest?

- 
```
def sum(a, b):
    """
    sum(4, 3)
    7   
    
    sum(-4, 5)
    1
    """
    return a + b
```
- 
```
def sum(a, b):
    """
    >>> sum(4, 3)
    7   
    
    >>> sum(-4, 5)
    1
    """
    return a + b
```
- 
```
def sum(a, b):
    """
    # >>> sum(4, 3)
    # 7   
    
    # >>> sum(-4, 5)
    # 1
    """
    return a + b     - True
```
- 
```
def sum(a, b):
    ###
    >>> sum(4, 3)
    7   
    
    >>> sum(-4, 5)
    1
    ###
    return a + b
```
#### Q13. What buit-in Python data type is commonly used to represent a stack?
- set
- list - True
- None. You can only build a stack from scratch.
- dictionary

#### Q14. What would this expression return?
```
college_years = ['Freshman', 'Sophomore', 'Junior', 'Senior']
return list(enumerate(college_years, 2019)
```
- `[('Freshman', 2019), ('Sophomore', 2020), ('Junior', 2021), ('Senior', 2022)]`
- `[(2019, 2020, 2021, 2022), ('Freshman', 'Sophomore', 'Junior', 'Senior')]`
- `[('Freshman', 'Sophomore', 'Junior', 'Senior'), (2019, 2020, 2021, 2022)]`
- `[(2019, 'Freshman'), (2020, 'Sophomore'), (2021, 'Junior'), (2022, 'Senior')]` - True

#### Q15. How does "defaultdict" work?
- "defaultdict" will automatically create a dictionary for you that has keys which are the integers 0-10
- "defaultdict" forces a dictionary to only accept keys that are of the types specified when you created the "defaultdict" (such as string or integers).
- If you try to access a key in a dictionary that doesn't exist, "defaultdict" will create a new key for you instead of throwing a "KeyError". - True
- "defaultdict" stores a copy of a dictionary in memory that you can default to if the original gets unintentionally modified.

#### Q16. What is the correct syntax for defining a class called "Game", if it inherits from a parent class called "LogicGame"?
- `class Game.LogicGame(): 
       pass`
- `def Game(LogicGame): 
       pass`
- `class Game(LogicGame): - True
       pass`
- `def Game.LogicGame(): 
       pass`

#### Q17. What is the correct syntax for calling an instance method on a class nameed "Game"?
- `my_game = Game(self): 
   self.my_game.roll_dice()`
- `my_game = Game(self): 
   my_game.roll_dice(self)`
- `my_game = Game(): 
   my_game.roll_dice()`
- `my_game = Game(): 
   self.my_game.roll_dice()`

#### Q18. What is the algorithmic paradigm of quick sort?
- divide and conquer  - True
- decrese and conquer 
- backtracking.
- dynamic programming

#### Q19. What is the key diffrence between a set and a list?
- Elements can be retrieved from a list but they cannot be retrieved from a set.
- A set is an ordered collection of non-unique items. A list is an unordered collection of unique items.
- A set is an ordered collection of unique items. A list is an unordered collection of non-unique items.
- A set is an unordered collection of unique items. A list is an ordered collection of non-unique items.

#### Q20. What is the definition of abstraction in object-oriented Python?
- Abstraction means that a diffrenet style of code can be used, since many details are already known to the program behind the scenes.
- Abstraction means the implementation is hidden from the user, and only the relevant data or information is shown. 
- Abstraction means that a class can inherit from more than one parent calss.
- Abstraction means that the data and functionality of a class are combined into one entity.

#### Q21. What biult-in Python data type is commonly used to represent a stack?
- set
- list  - True
- dictionary
- None. You can only biuld a stack from scratch.

#### Q22. What are attributes?
- Attributes are a long-form version of an if/else statments, used when testing equality between objects.
- Attributes are string that describe characteristics of class.
- Attributes are a way to hold data or describe a state for a class or an instance of a class.
- Function arguments are called "attributes" in the context of class methods and instance methods.  

#### Q23. What is a static method?
- Static methods are called static because they always return None.
- Static methods can access and modify the state of a class or an instance of a class. 
- Static methods can be bounded to either a class or an instance of a class. 
- They serve mostly the utility methods or helper methods, since they can't access or modify a class' state. - True

#### Q24. What is the purpose of the self keyword when defining or calling instance methods?
- 'self' refers to the instance whose method was called.  - True
- 'self' refers to the class that was inherited from to create to the object 'self'.
- 'self' means that no other arguments are required to be passed into methods.
- There is no real purpose for the 'self' method; it is just historic computer science jargon that Python keeps to stay consistent with other programming languages. 

#### Q25. Which statement does NOT describe the object-oriented programming concept of encapsulation?
- It protects the data from outside interface.
- It keeps data and the methods that can manipulate that data in one place.
- It only alows the data to be changed by methods.
- A parent calss is encapsulated and no data from the parent class passes on to the child class.
